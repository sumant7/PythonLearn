story= "Sumant is Good.\nSumant \t is Very good \\"
print(story)
# Output is

# Sumant          is Very good \

# \n is a newline character
# \t is tabspace

#to prevent print fucntion to print new lines

print("Hello",end="")
print("Hello",end="")
print("Hello",end="")
#outputs HelloHelloHello

#we can make end=" " to add space after each print
#by default end="\n"  and new lines gets printed
