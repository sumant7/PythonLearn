a=4
b=3


#arthematic operators  + - / *  
print(a%3)   #prints remainer when a is divided by 3

#assignment operators         we already say =
a+=2   #a=a+2
a-=2   #a=a-2
a*=2   #a=a*2
a/=2   #a=a/2
#note that after divding any number by any number result is always a float


#comparison operators    > < >= <=     returns boolean

c= (4>7)   
print(c)   #prints false

# 4==7    is 4 equal to 7?
# 4!=7    is 4 not equal to 7?



#logical operators
#basically boolean algebra
# and or not
